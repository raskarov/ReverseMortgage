	<br>
	MailBee WebMail .NET is an ASP.NET web application and its installation is a sequence of common for any ASP.NET application steps.
	<br>
	See "<a href="installation_instructions.html">Installation instructions</a>".<br>
	<br>
</p>
<p class="wmh_reg">
	<a name="2" class="wmh_txt"><b>2. License key doesn't work. Why?</b></a><br>
	<br>
	License key must be entered in "License Key" field of "WebMail Settings" dialog in "Administration console".
	To log in Administration console, navigate to http://where_webmail_is_installed/mailadm.aspx and use
	"mailadm"/"12345" settings as default username and password (if you haven't changed password earlier).<br>
	<br>
</p>
<p class="wmh_reg">
	<a name="3" class="wmh_txt"><b>3. Administration settings disappeared / are not saved. Why?</b></a><br>
		   <br>
		Common reason of settings not being saved is <b>ASPNET</b> (ASP.NET Machine Account) or <b>NETWORK SERVICE</b> account has
		insufficient permissions to the <b>data</b> folder. Please complete the steps below to grant the appropriate permissions:
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>using Windows Explorer, navigate to the folder which contains the <b>data</b> folder;</li>
			<li>in context menu, choose <b>"Properties"</b> of the <b>data</b> folder and <b>"Security"</b> tab;</li>
			<li>add <b>ASP.NET Machine Account (ASPNET)</b> and <b>NETWORK SERVICE</b> into the list;</li>
			<li>tick <b>"Allow full control"</b> checkboxes for both added accounts to grant permissions and press <b>"OK"</b>.</li>
		</ul>
	For Windows 2003 Server with IIS 6, the ASP.NET user account can differ from <b>ASPNET</b> or <b>NETWORK SERVICE</b>.
	To determine right user account under Windows 2003 Server, follow the steps below:
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>Run <b>Internet Information Services Manager</b>;</li>
		<li>In <b>&lt;SERVER_NAME&gt;/Web Sites/&lt;WEB_SITE_NAME&gt;/</b>, look for the WebMail application directory and
			  choose its properties (click <b>"Properties"</b> in context menu);</li>
		<li>In <b>"Virtual Directory"</b> tab, memorize the <b>"Application name"</b> value (it's the name of application pool you need);</li>
		<li>In <b>&lt;SERVER_NAME&gt;/Application Pools/</b>, look for the application pool which name you memorized and choose its properties;</li>
		<li>In <b>"Identity"</b> tab, you can see the system account name which is the ASP.NET user account you need.</li>
	</ul>
